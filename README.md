# Education: AngularJS
A simple mobile web application built with AngularJS for educational purpose.

## Why AngularJS?
Since jQuery no other JavaScript library or framework has blown me away like AngularJS. It brings MVC, separation of concerns and dependency injection to front-end development and fills a huge gap. For example, making changes to the model automatically updates the view and vice versa. This comes out of the box and doesn't have to be implemented with your own code. With its simple declarative syntax, even UI developers can add the right commands on their own.
